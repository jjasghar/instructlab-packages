This is the link to the different prebuilt stable builds of [InstructLab](https://instructlab.ai), this installs
the `ilab` command into your `$PATH` and allows you to engage with the `ilab` commands from the command line/terminal.

## Versions

As of the inital release, `0.17.1` we will only be building tagged "stable" from the [upstream](https://github.com/instructlab/instructlab/tree/stable)
GitHub page. This may change in the future, but this is the intial release.
